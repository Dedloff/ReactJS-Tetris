This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## ReactJS Tetris

This playable app was built using React JS, 3 custom Hooks, and the UseInterval hook created by Dan Abramov.

I also used Styled-Components for styling the stage, cells, display and game over screen.

Thanks for looking!
